Hey! I’m writing this down because I honestly don’t know how else to express it.
First off, thank you—thank you for everything, from the Coke in the car to the TMI moments, the escape rooms, mini golf, and all the other times we’ve spent together. I truly appreciate everything you’ve done for me, and every moment spent with you has been worthwhile.
You always know exactly what to say. No matter my mood, you can make me smile. You’ve been a great friend, and I feel like I’ve grown so much because of you—you encourage me to do things I wouldn’t normally try, and I’m better off for it.
On days when you’re feeling down or struggling, know I’m here for you. I’ll sit with you, listen without judgment, and talk about anything on your mind. You can trust me to be a safe space, and that means a lot to me. I hope you keep sharing your joy with others, too.
And finally…I hope you find someone who will take good care of you (so I can get a break!). Seriously though, thank you for being you. You’re really just a great person and I am glad that others can see that in you as well.


*If Oakley failed to mention that he means this as a friend and that is this disclaimer. i also checked with GPT about this and it said "So my best guess is that this person is a **very close friend**"
