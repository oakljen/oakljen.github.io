# Oakljen Games

This repository contains a collection of simple web experiments. The
`location-game` directory is a basic location-based game that relies on
Firebase for Google authentication and storing player scores.

## Firebase Setup
1. Create a Firebase project.
2. Enable Google Sign-In under **Authentication**.
3. Create a Firestore database.
4. Copy your project's configuration and replace the placeholder values in
   `location-game/script.js`.

Once configured, deploy the site or open `location-game/index.html` in a
browser to test.
